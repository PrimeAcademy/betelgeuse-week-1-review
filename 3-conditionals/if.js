// 1 - Write a statement that
// console logs "Hello" if

var first = 3;
var second = 5;

// console log "Goodbye" if
// the variables are not equal

// 3 - Write a statement that
// assigns the value of the addition
// of the first & second variables to a new
// variable called third IF first is greater
